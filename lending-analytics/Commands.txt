Step 42: Connect to the Aurora database

mysql -h labstack-b7cda654-4e64-4c3f-bf08-ba-lendingcluster-yjbr4dcrfcid.cluster-ro-cr4uzzg17axo.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com -P 3306 -u admin -p lending


Step 43: Retrieve the first 50 records in the lending table

SELECT * FROM lending_table LIMIT 50;


Step 44: Find the total payment of each loan type in the lending table

SELECT loan_type, SUM(CAST(payment AS decimal(18,2))) FROM lending_table GROUP BY loan_type;


Step 49: Create external schema in Amazon Redshift

 CREATE EXTERNAL SCHEMA lending_schema
 FROM MYSQL
 DATABASE 'lending'
 URI 'INSERT-READER-INSTANCE-ENDPOINT'
 IAM_ROLE 'INSERT-IAM-ROLE-ARN'
 SECRET_ARN 'INSERT-SECRET-ARN';


Step 52: Find the total payment of each loan type in the lending table 

SELECT loan_type, SUM(CAST(payment AS decimal(18,2))) FROM lending_schema.lending_table GROUP BY loan_type;


Step 54: Create a materialized view

CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW MV_Lending AS
SELECT loan_type, SUM(CAST(payment AS decimal(18,2))) FROM lending_schema.lending_table GROUP BY loan_type;


Step 57: Disable cache

SET enable_result_cache_for_session TO OFF;



Step 58: Retrieve all records from the materialized view

SELECT * FROM MV_Lending;



DIY: Hints

1. To enable auto scaling in the Amazon Aurora cluster, use the following policy configurations: Target metric = Average connections of Aurora Replicas, Target value = 3 connections, Minimum capacity = 3 Aurora Replicas.

2. Before recreating the external schema, you need to delete the one created in the practice session by using the following SQL command:

DROP schema lending_schema CASCADE;

3. After deletion, you can recreate the external schema by replacing the URI parameter with the Aurora cluster reader endpoint that enables load balancing.
